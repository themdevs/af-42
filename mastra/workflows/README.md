# Workflows overview

Workflows let you define and orchestrate complex sequences of tasks as typed steps connected by data flows. Each step has clearly defined inputs and outputs validated by Zod schemas.

A workflow manages execution order, dependencies, branching, parallelism, and error handling â€” enabling you to build robust, reusable processes. Steps can be nested or cloned to compose larger workflows.
