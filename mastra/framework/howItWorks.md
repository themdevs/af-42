# TIMMY Framework: How It Works

This document explains the architecture and functionality of the TIMMY framework files and their interconnected systems.

## Framework Overview

TIMMY is a comprehensive Claude Code enhancement framework that provides structured workflows, specialized agents, behavioral rules, and MCP (Model Control Protocol) server integrations for advanced software engineering tasks.

## Directory Structure & Components

### 📁 Core/

- **Foundation files that define framework behavior**

- **`PRINCIPLES.md`** - Core software engineering philosophy and decision-making framework
  - Evidence-based reasoning over assumptions
  - SOLID principles and systems thinking
  - Quality quadrants: Functional, Structural, Performance, Security

- **`RULES.md`** - Actionable behavioral rules with priority system
  - 🔴 Critical: Security, data safety, production breaks
  - 🟡 Important: Quality, maintainability, professionalism
  - 🟢 Recommended: Optimization, style, best practices
  - Workflow patterns: Understand → Plan → TodoWrite → Execute → Validate

- **`FLAGS.md`** - Behavioral control flags for execution modes
  - Mode activation: `--brainstorm`, `--introspect`, `--orchestrate`
  - MCP server control: `--sequential`, `--magic`, `--context7`
  - Analysis depth: `--think`, `--think-hard`, `--ultrathink`

- **`BUSINESS_SYMBOLS.md`** & **`BUSINESS_PANEL_EXAMPLES.md`** - Business context integration

### 📁 Commands/

- **Specialized command implementations for complex workflows**

Each command file defines:

- **Triggers**: When to activate the command
- **Behavioral Flow**: Step-by-step execution pattern
- **MCP Integration**: Which servers to leverage
- **Tool Coordination**: How tools work together
- **Boundaries**: What the command will/won't do

Key commands include:

- **`analyze.md`** - Deep code and system analysis
- **`implement.md`** - Feature implementation workflows
- **`troubleshoot.md`** - Systematic problem solving
- **`workflow.md`** - Multi-step process orchestration
- **`index.md`** - Project documentation generation

### 📁 Personas/

- **Specialized personas for different engineering domains**

Agent files define behavioral mindsets and expertise areas:

- **`system-architect.md`** - Holistic architecture design, 10x scalability thinking
- **`performance-engineer.md`** - Optimization and bottleneck analysis
- **`security-engineer.md`** - Threat modeling and vulnerability assessment
- **`quality-engineer.md`** - Testing strategies and code quality
- **`technical-writer.md`** - Documentation and communication

Each agent includes:

- **Triggers**: When to activate this mindset
- **Focus Areas**: Domain expertise
- **Key Actions**: Specific behaviors
- **Outputs**: Deliverable types
- **Boundaries**: Scope limitations

### 📁 Modes/

- **Behavioral state modifiers that change framework operation**

- **`MODE_Orchestration.md`** - Intelligent tool selection and resource management
  - Tool selection matrix for optimal routing
  - Resource awareness (Green/Yellow/Red zones)
  - Parallel execution optimization

- **`MODE_Task_Management.md`** - Complex multi-step coordination
- **`MODE_Token_Efficiency.md`** - Resource-constrained operation
- **`MODE_Brainstorming.md`** - Collaborative discovery
- **`MODE_Introspection.md`** - Meta-cognitive analysis
- **`MODE_Business_Panel.md`** - Business stakeholder simulation

### 📁 MCP/

- **Model Control Protocol server integrations**

#### Server Definitions

- **`MCP_Sequential.md`** - Multi-step reasoning engine for complex analysis
- **`MCP_Context7.md`** - Curated documentation and framework patterns
- **`MCP_Magic.md`** - Modern UI component generation
- **`MCP_Morphllm.md`** - Bulk code transformations
- **`MCP_Serena.md`** - Symbol operations and project memory
- **`MCP_Playwright.md`** - Browser automation and testing

#### Configuration Files

- **`configs/*.json`** - Server-specific configuration settings

## Framework Operation Flow

### 1. **Request Analysis**

```bash
User Request → Flag Detection → Mode Activation → Agent Selection
```

### 2. **Planning Phase**

```bash
Requirements Analysis → Scope Definition → Tool Selection → TodoWrite Creation
```

### 3. **Execution Phase**

```bash
Parallel Operations → Progress Tracking → Validation Gates → Quality Checks
```

### 4. **Validation Phase**

```bash
Output Verification → Rule Compliance → Quality Assessment → Cleanup
```

## Key Design Patterns

### **Hierarchical Decision Making**

1. **Safety First**: Security and data rules always win
2. **Scope > Features**: Build only what's asked
3. **Quality > Speed**: Except in genuine emergencies
4. **Context Matters**: Prototype vs Production requirements differ

### **Parallelization Strategy**

- **Default**: Parallel operations unless dependencies require sequential
- **Batching**: Group related operations (MultiEdit > individual Edits)
- **Resource Awareness**: Adapt based on system constraints
- **Efficiency Focus**: Choose most powerful tool for each task

### **Quality Gates**

- **Pre-execution**: Validation before making changes
- **During execution**: Progress tracking and error handling
- **Post-execution**: Lint, typecheck, and test verification
- **Cleanup**: Temporary file removal and workspace hygiene

## MCP Server Selection Logic

### When to Use Each Server

**Sequential MCP**: Complex multi-step analysis requiring systematic reasoning

```bash
Complex debugging → System design → Multi-component investigation
```

**Context7 MCP**: Framework-specific patterns and official documentation

```bash
Library questions → Pattern guidance → Standard compliance
```

**Magic MCP**: Modern UI component generation

```bash
/ui commands → Design system queries → Frontend development
```

**Morphllm MCP**: Bulk code transformations

```bash
Pattern-based edits → Style enforcement → Multi-file changes
```

**Serena MCP**: Symbol operations and project memory

```bash
Large codebase navigation → Session persistence → Semantic understanding
```

**Playwright MCP**: Browser testing and automation

```bash
E2E testing → Visual validation → Accessibility testing
```

## Integration Points

### **Command ↔ Agent Integration**

Commands orchestrate workflows while agents provide domain expertise mindsets.

### **Mode ↔ Tool Integration**

Modes modify tool selection and resource management strategies.

### **MCP ↔ Native Tool Integration**

MCP servers enhance native Claude Code tools with specialized capabilities.

### **Rule ↔ Validation Integration**

Rules provide decision criteria while validation ensures compliance.
