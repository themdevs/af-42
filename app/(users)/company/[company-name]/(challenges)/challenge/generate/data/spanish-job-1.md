# Senior Frontend Developer \u2014 Frontend Technical Challenge
**Seniority Target:** senior
**Primary Stack:** JavaScript, Angular, Ionic, Git, Jasmine
**Domain Context:** Development of hybrid applications in the security sector.

---

## 1) Problem Overview
You are tasked with developing a hybrid mobile application using Angular and Ionic that serves as a security alert system for users. The application should allow users to receive alerts, view security tips, and report incidents. The challenge will assess your ability to implement best practices in code quality, technical implementation, and problem-solving.

## 2) Requirements
### Functional
- [ ] Implement a user interface that displays a list of security alerts.
- [ ] Allow users to report a new incident through a form.
- [ ] Integrate a mock API to fetch alerts and submit reports.
- [ ] Ensure the application is responsive and works on both mobile and tablet devices.

### Non-Functional
- Performance: The application should load alerts within 2 seconds.
- Accessibility: Ensure the application meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
- Documentation: Provide clear code documentation and a README file.

### Constraints
- Allowed: JavaScript, Angular v12, Ionic 6, Git, Jasmine, Cordova, OpenAPI, RxJS
- Disallowed: External paid APIs, Embedded credentials, Proprietary libraries
- External services: Mock the API unless explicitly allowed

## 3) Data & Interfaces
- Use a mock API to simulate fetching alerts and submitting reports. The API should return a list of alerts in JSON format and accept incident reports as JSON.

## 4) Tasks & Milestones
1. Set up the project structure using Angular and Ionic.
2. Create components for displaying alerts and reporting incidents.
3. Implement the mock API integration.
4. Write unit tests using Jasmine for critical components.
5. Document the code and create a README with setup instructions.

## 5) Deliverables
- A Git repository containing the complete source code.
- A README file with setup instructions and usage guidelines.
- Basic test coverage for the implemented features.

## 6) Evaluation Rubric
- **Code Quality (30%)**: Adherence to best practices, readability, and maintainability.
- **Technical Implementation (40%)**: Functionality, responsiveness, and integration with the mock API.
- **Problem Solving (20%)**: Ability to address edge cases and implement features effectively.
- **Documentation (10%)**: Clarity and completeness of code documentation and README.

## 7) Provided Artifacts
- Mock API documentation (to be created by the candidate).
- Sample data for alerts and incident reports.

## 8) Stretch Goals
- Implement performance optimizations for loading alerts.
- Enhance error handling for API requests.
- Improve code organization by implementing a state management solution.

## 9) Submission Instructions
- Submit your Git repository link via email.
- Ensure that the repository is public and does not contain any proprietary data or secrets.

## Assumptions
- The candidate has access to a development environment with Node.js and Angular CLI installed.
- The candidate is familiar with Agile methodologies and can work independently.
